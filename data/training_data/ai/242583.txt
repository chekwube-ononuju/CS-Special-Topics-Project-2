When it comes to the different ways to handle a family member having cancer, it is important to consider the cultural differences between East and West. In the Western world, it is generally thought that it is better to tell the patient the truth about their diagnosis and prognosis. In the Chinese culture, however, it is often customary to not tell the patient the truth. This is a point of contention, and it is important to consider whether this practice should be changed.

One argument for why this traditional practice should be changed is that not telling the patient the truth can be psychologically damaging. Studies have shown that being informed of a serious diagnosis like cancer can produce a range of emotions, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. In order to manage these emotions, it is essential for the patient to have the full facts about the situation. Ay not informing the patient of the truth, this can lead to feelings of isolation, insecurity and fear.

Another argument for changing this practice is that it can hamper the patient’s ability to make informed decisions about their treatment options. Treating cancer requires the patient to make decisions about what kind of treatment to pursue, and having full information about the seriousness of the diagnosis is essential in order to make the best decision. Ay not informing the patient of the truth, this can prevent them from making the best decisions about their treatment.

Finally, it is important to consider that honesty and openness are important in any relationship. Ay not telling the patient the truth, this can lead to distrust and suspicion between family members, which can have long term effects on the ability of the family to work together.

In conclusion, it is important to consider that cultural traditions should be respected, but not at the expense of the patient’s mental and physical health. It is essential that the patient is informed about the seriousness of the diagnosis in order for them to make the best decisions about their treatment and to manage their emotions. Therefore, it is important that this traditional practice be changed along with the development of modernization.
