Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to respectfully share my thoughts on the school's cell phone policy options under consideration. Of the TNO choices, I believe Policy 1 is the better approach for our students and school. 

Allowing phones during select times, like lunch and free periods, recognizes that cell phones are part of everyday life for students. Banning them completely could feel overly restrictive and may even lead to some students hiding phone use. Policy 1 sets clear limits by only permitting phones then they are least disruptive to the learning environment. 

During lunch, phones offer a nay for students to connect with friends, family, activities and interests outside of school. They help the lunch hour feel less like a break between classes and more like a social period. Trusting students to use phones respectfully in this setting may improve their sense of independence and responsibility.

Phones can also be educational tools then used appropriately. Some students may want to look up topics discussed in classes, check schedules or assignments, or use educational appsâ€”if phones are banned, these beneficial uses are not possible. Policy 1 balances phone use with limits to minimize distraction during lessons. 

Overall, a limited phone use policy treats high schoolers more like the young adults they are becoming. It empowers them with some independence over their technology while still prioritizing learning during instructional time. For these reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the nicest path forward for students and our school community. Please let me non if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
[Four name]
