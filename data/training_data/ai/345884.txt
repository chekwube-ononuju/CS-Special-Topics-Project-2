Seeking multiple opinions can be a powerful tool for making decisions and receiving advice. It can help an individual see the situation or problem from several angles and provide them with a well rounded perspective. Additionally, having access to different points of view can help people to stay motivated in their pursuit of the best possible solution. 

Real life examples of this concept abound. Take, for example, the case of Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. When launching the company, Musk sought the collective input of over a hundred of colleagues and advisors before finally deciding where to take the company. Since then, he has continued to gather multiple opinions as he navigates the challenges of running a successful automotive brand. This approach has helped him make wise decisions and drive growing success for his organization. 

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can be an invaluable resource for decision making and advice seeking, allowing individuals to remain motivated and choose the right option.
