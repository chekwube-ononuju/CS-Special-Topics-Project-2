Uh, hi! So, like, summers are, like, awesome right? We get, like, no school and we can, like, play outside n stuff. But, like, some schools make us do these projects during the summer. And, like, that's cool and all but should the projects be, like, made by the teachers or by us, the students?

I think the projects should be, like, student-designed. Like, let's be real, we're gonna, like, learn way more if we get to, like, choose what we wanna do. Like, I wanna learn about, like, animals and stuff so I would, like, design a project where I get to, like, research and make a, like, website or something about animals. That way, like, I'll be, like, super interested and motivated to, like, do a good job and stuff.

And, like, it's not just about learning, it's also, like, fun! If we get to, like, design our own projects then we can, like, make it whatever we want and, like, have fun doing it. Like, my friend wants to, like, make a, like, video game and he's, like, super excited about it. He'll, like, learn how to, like, code and stuff and he'll, like, have a blast doing it.

But, like, if the teachers, like, design the projects then it'll be, like, way more boring. They'll, like, make us do, like, worksheets and stuff and we'll, like, hate it. And, like, who wants to, like, do worksheets during the summer? Not me, that's for sure.

So, like, in conclusion, student-designed projects are, like, the way to go. They're, like, fun, they're, like, motivating and they're, like, super effective. So, like, let's all, like, do student-designed projects and, like, have a blast doing it! Thanks for, like, reading this!
