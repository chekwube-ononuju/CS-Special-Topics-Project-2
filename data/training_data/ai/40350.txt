Dear Ms. Smith,

I think that policy 1 is the beter choice fore us, the students. alot of times we need to comunicate with our parrents or gaurdians when we are at skool, like if we have an emergency or somethin and we need to tell them somethin important. also, durin lunch we can play games or watch videos and it will make the time go by faster. It will also be good fore us to practice bein resposible and mature with our phones.
also, if we arent alowed to have phones at skool, then we would be borred out of our minds and it would be hard fore us to focous in clase.
also, pepole can cheat on tests and stuff if they dont have there phones so they have to rely on there memorys.
also, it is a good thing to have in case of an emergency, like a fire or sumthing and the teachers need to contact our parrents.
also, i think that we should have the freedom to choos wat we want to do in our free time, and we shuld be alowed to have our phones.
so i hope you will consider Policy 1.

Thank you for listening to my opinion.

Sinserly,

joe bob.
