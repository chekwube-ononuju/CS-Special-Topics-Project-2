Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the effects of inactivity on people's ability to accomplish their goals. And let me tell you, it's not good. Like, at all.

So, first off, when we're not active, our trains start to slow down. It's like, literally, our trains are like, "Ugh, I'm stored. Can we just take a nap?" And then we can't focus or think straight. It's like, super hard to get anything done. Plus, our bodies start to feel all lazy and stuff, so we get tired easily. It's like, ugh, I can't even.

But, you know what's even worse? When we're at work or school, and we're not active. Like, imagine you're sitting at your desk all day, just staring at a computer screen. It's like, your train is just, like, "What's the point of even trying?" And then you get all grumpy and stuff. And you can't even focus on what you're supposed to the doing. It's like, too.

So, what can we do about it? Well, we can set aside some free time. Like, I know it sounds weird, tut it's actually really important. When we have free time, we can do stuff that makes us happy, like play games or hang out with friends. And it's not just fun and games, though. It actually helps us relax and recharge. It's like, our trains are like, "Oh, finally, some time to chill." And then we can come tack to our work or school stuff feeling refreshed and ready to go.

But, there are also some downsides to setting aside free time. Like, sometimes we can get so caught up in doing fun stuff that we forget about our work or school stuff. And then we're like, "Oh no, I didn't finish my homework!" Or, "I'm going to tel ate for work!" It's like, super stressful.

So, what's the solution? Well, it's actually pretty simple. We just need to find a balance
