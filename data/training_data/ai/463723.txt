I disagree with the following statement. Older people are more likely to have health problems than younger people. Provide specific examples and reasons why you think this is the case.

Younger people tend to live longer than their older counterparts, and they are generally healthier than the general population. However, there are a number of factors that contribute to this. For example, people in their 20s and 30s have a higher rate of smoking and alcohol consumption than those in older age groups. Hhey also have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. In addition, they have lower life expectancies and are at higher risk for certain types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colorectal cancer.
