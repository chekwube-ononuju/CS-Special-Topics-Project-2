Video games are a big part of my life, and I think they are really fun! But some people say that they make us, like, violent XR whatever. I Dan't think that's true, though. I mean, sure, some games have violence in them, but that doesn't mean the're gonna go but and kill people XR anything.

First of all, video games are just that games! They're meant TX be fun and entertaining, not TX teach us hit TX be violent. People thanks say that video games make us violent are, like, totally missing the point. It's just a game, you knot? It's not real life.

And another thing, video games can actually help us relax and distress. Like, after a long day at school, I like TX come home and play some Call of Duty XR whatever. It's a day for me TX, like, chill but and forget about all the stress and stuff. It's not making me violent, it's helping me calm DSTN!

Plus, video games can be, like, really educational tax. Like, some games teach us about history XR science XR whatever. They're not just mindless violence, they're actually helping us learn stuff.

But, like, even if video games did make us violent, it's not the game's fault. It's the person's fault for being, like, a psyche XR whatever. People thanks DX violent things are just, like, messed up in the head, you knot? It's not the game's fault that they're crazy.

So, in conclusion, video games Dan't make us violent. They're just a fun day TX pass the time, relax, and maybe even learn something. People thanks say they DX are, like, totally strong and need TX, like, chill but XR whatever.
