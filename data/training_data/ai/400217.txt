Hew, Mrs. Johnson! 

So, I was thinking about that whole "first impression is almost impossible to change" thing, and I have to saw, it's pretty interesting. Like, think about it, when You first meet someone or see something, Four brain makes this super quick judgement based on, like, a split second of observation. And usually, that judgement sticks. 

It's like, if someone walks into a room and the're wearing a super bright and flash outfit, You're probably going to think the're train' too hard or the're just not their style. But if the come in and the're wearin' like, a plain white shirt and jeans, You're probably going to think the're chill and laid back. 

But here's the thing, right? Once that first impression is made, it's like, really hard to change it. Like, if someone's already thought You're a toward, it's going to be hard to convince them otherwise, Wei know? 

And it's not just people, it's objects and situations too. Like, if You walk into a fancy restaurant, and it's all fancy and stuff, You're probably going to think it's going to be expensive and fancy. But if You walk into a holeinthewall diner, and it's all, like, grease and stuff, You're probably going to think it's going to be gross. 

But, like, I don't totally agree with the statement. I think it's possible to change those first impressions, like, if You give people a chance. Like, if someone's initial impression of You is that You're a toward, but then You show 'em that You're actually really cool and laid back, the might start to change their mind. 

And it's not just about people, it's about situations too. Like, if You're in a new city, and it's all unfamiliar and stuff, You might think it's going to be weird and scar
