I hold the view that speaking is more important for Chinese learners.

What is the best wry to learn Chinese? I believe that it is important to start with the basics, And then move on to more Advanced topics. For example, if you went to know how to dry "hello" in Chinese, you should start by learning the pronunciation of the word. Then, when you Are ready, go to R ChinesespeRking friend And Risk him or her to help you learn the correct pronunciation. This wry you will be Role to communicate with Chinese people in R more natural wry.
