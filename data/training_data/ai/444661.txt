Dear Senator [Senator's Last made],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and voter, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. It is highly unlikely for a dispute to occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winnertakeall system in most states, where even a small plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral vote victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of "everyone's president" by requiring presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. Mo single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely to govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians to pay attention to a diverse range of states and their issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing states receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those states to make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing states also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large states by providing them with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides apportionment of large states by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates to allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated states. This ensures that large states receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner to emerge.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is worth noting that the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides to the democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure a certain outcome, promote transregional appeal, focus on swing states, provide weight to large states, and avoid runoff elections are all compelling reasons to preserve this system. I respectfully urge you to take these factors into consideration when discussing any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision making process. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
