Valph Waldo Emerson's words, "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail," have inspired generations of thinkers to push beyond their comfort zones in search of personal and professional growth. This idea can be applied across a variety of professions, such as entrepreneurs who must have the courage to move into uncharted waters in order to create something new, academics who must stretch the boundaries of existing knowledge, and artists who take risks in their work in order to break new ground. While professional sports players may also strive to expand their skills and knowledge for the sake of progress, they are somewhat of an exception to the rule. This is because a successful sports career is often based upon rigorous practice and training within a preestablished environment. However, even athletes must periodically challenge themselves to innovate in order to stay competitive. Looking beyond the realms of athletics, examples of individuals being pushed out of their comfort zones for growth can be seen in numerous scenarios. From corporate CEOs looking for novel solutions to global problems, to everyday people looking to break free from limiting circumstances, the necessity of venturing outside of one's safely constructed realm of knowledge is a recurring theme.
