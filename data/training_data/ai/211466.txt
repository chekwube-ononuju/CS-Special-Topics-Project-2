Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about why it's important to be aware of our actions when it comes to items found on the ground. Like, you know, stuff that's just lying around on the ground, like pens, money, or even that cool new toy you saw at the park. 🤔

So, here's my thing: people should not take something that's not theirs, like, ever. I know it might seem like a cool find, but think about how the person who lost it must feel! 😔 They might have really needed that thing, and now it's gone. It's like, basic human decency to not take something that doesn't belong to you. 🤷‍♀️

For real, imagine if you lost your favorite toy or something, and someone just took it without asking. eou'Eoue super upset, right? 😡 So, why should someone else get to take something that doesn't belong to them just because they found it? It's not fair, and it's not right. 🤷‍♂️

And, like, think about it from the other person's perspective. They might have worked hard for that thing, or it might be super important to them. Just because you found it on the ground doesn't mean it's yours to take! 🙅‍♀️ It's like, respect the other person's property, ya know? 🤝

Okay, so, yeah, maybe you might find something really cool on the ground, but it's just not worth it if it means taking something that doesn't belong to you. It's like, always be honest and respectful of other people's stuff, even if it's not yours. 🤝 That's just how you should be, you know? 😊

So, yeah, that's my argument. Don't take something that's not yours, even if it's just lying around on the ground. It's important to be aware of our actions and to always do the right thing, even if
