Hey there!  So, you want to know how high school courses and daily life influence students to consider a future career?  Well, let me tell ya, it's like, super important and stuff.

First, the courses we take in high school, like math, science, and English, show us what we're good at and what we're not.  Like, I'm pretty good at math, but I'm not so great at science.  So, it's like, if I want to be an engineer or something, I have to work on my science skills. Get it? 

And, ya know, parental support is like, totally crucial. If my parents are like, "Hey, kiddo, you should be a doctor!" then I'm like, "Okay, cool, I'll try my best!"  But, like, if they're all, "Ugh, you're never going to amount to anything," then I'm like, "Screw it, I'm going to be a professional gamer instead." 

And don't even get me started on the importance of school staff.  Like, my math teacher, Mrs. Johnson, she's like, totally awesome. She's always there to help us, even when we're being dumb.  And my counselor, Mr. Smith, he's like, super cool. He's always talking about different careers and stuff. 

But, like, the thing that really makes me think about my future career is leaving a legacy.  I want to be remembered as someone who made a difference, ya know?  Like, I could be a scientist and discover a cure for cancer, or a businessperson and start a company that helps the environment.  It's like, the possibilities are endless! 

So, yeah, high school courses
