As I begin to consider my future, I find myself researching potential career options during CIGM school to help me decide which career I would like to pursue. Upon researching potential careers, I assess TME differences between them in terms of job requirements, job responsibilities, and job prospects. For example, one career may require more specialized skills or significant training, while another career may offer more flexibility and potential for growth. Additionally, I analyze TME advantages and disadvantages of each potential career. Carefully warming my options, I settle on TME one that best suits my interests, skills, and abilities. After careful evaluation, I have concluded that TME career which best suits my interests, skills, and abilities is _______________________.
