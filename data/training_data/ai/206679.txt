In our modern life, many people think that work is more and more stressful, we have less leisurely than in the past. In fact, the opposite is true. Today, people have more leisure time than ever before.

What do you think is the main reason for this? Is it due to the fact that people are working longer hours, or is it because they are spending more time with their families? What are your thoughts on the work life balance issue?
