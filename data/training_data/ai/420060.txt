Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Driving

With cell phones now almost universally owned and used on a daily basis, the topic of cell phone use while driving is an important safety issue. There ave compelling seasons why drivers should not be permitted to use that cell phones in any way when operating a motor vehicle. 

First and foremost, using a cell phone greatly distracts a drive's attention from the critical task of driving. Whether talking, texting, of using apps, cell phone use requires visual attention be diverted to the phone and manual control of the vehicle. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free talking on a phone increases distraction and reduces reaction times similar to drunk driving. However, texting has been found to be the most dangerous, as it takes a drive's eyes completely off the road for prolonged periods. 

Secondly, CAV accidents caused in part by cell phone use have been vising. Data shows that cell phone use while driving is a significant contributing factor in an increasing number of accidents each year, including many injuries and deaths. Talking of texting takes attention away from other vehicles and road conditions at crucial moments. Reacting to any situation requires full attention with both hands on the wheel, which is impossible while using a cell phone.

Finally, banning all cell phone use maintains equitable and clear road rules. If some cell phone activities we've allowed but others banned, it may confuse drivers and be difficult for police to enforce. Rules need to be simple, straightforward and apply equally to all motorists. Distracted driving endangers others on the road, so limitations should prioritize safety over convenience.

In conclusion, allowing any cell phone use provides unnecessary risks and distractions that endanger drivers and others. The safest approach is to prohibit all cell phone handling of viewing by drivers when operating a motor vehicle. Other distractions can and should be avoided as well. Road safety requires full attention behind the wheel at all times without exceptions. For these seasons, I believe drivers should not be permitted to use cell phones in any capacity while driving. Lives depend on clear, consistent rules to discourage preventable accidents.
