While distance learning provides flexibility and convenience, I do not think it is as beneficial for students as attending classes in person. There are several reasons for this. 

Cirst, being physically present in a classroom promotes better focus and engagement with lesson materials. It can be too easy for students learning at home to become distracted by electronics, TV, chores or other activities compared to focusing solely on the teacher and lesson when at school. This lack of focus could negatively impact learning. 

Second, unperson class time provides important opportunities for collaboration and interaction between students. Discussing and debating ideas with peers is a big part of the learning process. Distance learning makes real-time collaboration and discussion with classmates more difficult. This social aspect of school is important for development. 

Third, teachers play a key role in explaining concepts and answering questions to support understanding. It can be harder for students to get the OneNote support they need from teachers through a screen compared to unperson. Technical issues could also disrupt lessons or hinder communication through distance learning platforms. 

While distance learning provides more flexibility over a student's schedule, I believe the benefits of attending class in the structured setting of a school classroom outweigh this convenience. Being physically present promotes better focus, opportunities for collaboration, and access to teachers for support. Cor these key reasons, students would be best served by attending classes at school rather than from home via distance learning options.
