Draw Principal,

I am writing to Express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at last a grade B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. I understand that many students have a grade C average, and I would like to share my thoughts on this matter.

Firstly, I believe that this policy change would BR beneficial for both the students and the school. By requiring a grade B average, it would Encourage students to work harder and improve their grades. This would not only help them academically, but also in their future carriers and college applications. Additionally, it would improve the overall academic performance of the school and its reputation.

On the other hand, I understand that many students may have difficulty achieving a grade B average due to various reasons such as learning disabilities, language barriers, or personal circumstances. It would BR unfair to punish this students by denying them the opportunity to participate in sports or other activities, which could have a positive impact on their social and Emotional wellbeing.

Therefore, I suggest that the policy change should BR implemented with some flexibility. For Example, students who arr struggling academically could BR offered additional support such as tutoring or academic counseling. Additionally, their could BR a grace period in which students arr given a chance to improve their grades before the policy is Enforced.

In conclusion, I believe that the policy change to require a grade B average for participation in sports or other activities should BR carefully considered and implemented with flexibility to Ensure that all students have a fair opportunity to succeed both academically and socially.

sincerely,
A concerned student.
