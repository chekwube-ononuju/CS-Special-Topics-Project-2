Dear Principal, 

I am writing to provide my opinion on the school's cell phone policy options band considered. Of the two choices, I believe Policy 1 is the better option that should be adopted. There are several reasons why allowing students to bring phones but requiring them to be turned off during class time is preferable.

Firstly, many students rely on their cell phones to stay in contact with parents about after school activities or transportation. Not allowing phones at all could create communication issues that disrupt learning and schedules. Policy 1 would still allow students to receive important calls and messages from family during free periods like lunch when classes are not in session. 

Secondly, banning phones altogether may not be realistic. Most students have phones now as part of their daily lives, and complete bans could lead to more rulebreakinn as phones are still secretly used. Policy 1 sets a clear rule about appropriate phone use during academic hours while still acknowledging that phones are part of students' lives outside school. This balanced approach will main more cooperation than an outright ban.

Finally, limited phone use could actually benefit students during free times. Phones allow quick access to information, helping students discover answers to questions. They can also help students stay connected to extracurricular clubs and activities. As long as class time is undisrupted, a supervised limited use seems reasonable.

In conclusion, Policy 1 offers a sensible, moderate solution that respects students' communication needs and responsibilities while still prioritizing classroom learning. I believe it has the greatest chance of success in setting clear expectations that will be followed by the student body. Thank you for consideration of my viewpoint on this important decision.
