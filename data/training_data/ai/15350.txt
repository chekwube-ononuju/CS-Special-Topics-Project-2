Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give small states more influence, today's system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote and democratic fairness. 

Supporters of keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on a few high population states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates concentrate campaigning and advertising in only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. With a popular vote, every vote would matter equally and candidates would need to appeal to a broader range of citizens. It would encourage higher voter turnout nationwide rather than selective turnout in swing states.

It is also argued that the Electoral College system maintains the federal character of the election by giving small states more say. But in practice, the national popular vote winner almost always wins the Electoral College too. So the system does not significantly boost small states' influence. Furthermore, allocating electoral votes based on congressional districts in some states has politicized the redistricting process and led to instances of partisan gerrymandering to benefit one party. 

A nationwide popular vote would be a simpler, more straightforward and democratic process. It would ensure that the candidate preferred by the most Americans would become president. While changing to the popular vote may need an amendment, moving in this direction could help address concerns about how some recent elections have undermined faith in our democratic system. For these reasons, I believe moving to a national popular vote is a better approach and ensures that every valid vote has an equal say in choosing the president.
