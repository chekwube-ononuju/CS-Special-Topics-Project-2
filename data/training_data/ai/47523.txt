The development of driverless cars is a topic that has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that these vehicles represent the future of transportation, others are more skeptical. After reading the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," it is clear that there are both positive and negative aspects of this technology. In my opinion, the limitations, privacy concerns, and economic challenges associated with driverless cars outweigh the potential benefits, and therefore, I am against the development of these cars.

One of the primary limitations of driverless cars is their current technological limitations. As the article states, these vehicles are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. They require human intervention and constant vigilance, which raises questions about their practicality. If a driver still needs to be actively engaged, are these cars truly driverless? This lack of full autonomy diminishes the benefits of driverless cars and makes them less appealing.

Another significant concern is privacy. Some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, which raises serious privacy issues. The thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling, and this invasion of privacy could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. As the article states, traditional cars without such surveillance have generally performed well, which suggests that this feature is not necessary.

The economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are also substantial. These vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with them. The cost of such upgrades would be exorbitantly expensive, and it's unclear who would bear these costs. Additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. The logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting.

In conclusion, while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, their current form leaves much to be desired. The focus should perhaps be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesn't yet align with practical, economic, or privacy-related concerns. As the article states, the driverless car revolution seems more like an unnecessary leap rather than a necessary step forward in automotive technology. Therefore, I am against the development of driverless cars.
