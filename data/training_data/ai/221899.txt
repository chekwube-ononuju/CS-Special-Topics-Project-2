 Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that promote a more sustainable and livable environment. The passage set provides evidence that supports this claim, and Z will address some counterclaims before presenting my argument.

Firstly, limiting car usage reduces air pollution, a significant health hazard in urban areas. According to the passage from "Carefree Cities," Vauban, a German suburb, has fewer cars, resulting in cleaner air and better health for its residents (Rosenthal). Similarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, which significantly reduced pollution levels (Duffer). These examples demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality.

Moreover, promoting alternative transportation, such as biking, walking, or public transportation, can lead to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system. As described in the passage from "Carefree Day," Bogot√°, Colombia, has seen a significant increase in the use of bicycles and public transportation, resulting in a reduction in smog and traffic congestion (Silky). This shift towards sustainable transportation can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a healthier environment.

However, some may argue that limiting car usage can lead to increased traffic congestion and longer commute times. For instance, the passage from "The End of Car Culture" notes that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, which could negatively impact the car industry (Rosenthal). However, as shown in the passage from "Carefree Cities," implementing alternative transportation systems can actually improve traffic flow and reduce congestion (Rosenthal).

To address these counterclaims, it is essential to consider other factors that influence car usage. For example, the availability and accessibility of public transportation can significantly impact an individual's decision to own a car
