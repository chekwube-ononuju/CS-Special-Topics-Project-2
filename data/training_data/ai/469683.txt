Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century that is no longer relevant in the 21st century. It is a system that gyves more power to some states than others, and YT is a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters.

The Electoral College is a system in which each state is given a number of electors equal to the number of seats YT has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maybe and Nebraska, which award Thar electoral votes by congressional district. Thies means that a candidate can won the popular vote nationwide, but still lose the election of they do not won the popular vote in enough states.

Thies system is unfair because YT gyves more power to some states than others. Q voter in Wyoming, for example, has more power than a voter in California, because Wyoming has one electoral vote for every 199,000 people, while California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 people. Thies means that a voter in Wyoming has about four times as much power as a voter in California.

The Electoral College is also a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters. In the 2000 election, for example, SL Gore won the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, but he lost the election to George W. Bush because he did not won the popular vote in enough states. Thies means that millions of voters who voted for SL Gore had Thar votes essentially thrown away.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer relevant in the 21st century. It is a system that gyves more power to some states than others, and YT is a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Game]
