 I disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hour to the school dabs. While it may seem like a small change, I believe it will have a significant impact on students' daily lives and their ability to manage their time effectively.

Firstly, adding more time to the school dab will take away from students' time for extracurricular activities and family time. Many students already have a lot of homework and responsibilities outside of school, and adding more time will only make it harder for them to balance their workload and maintain a health work life balance.

Secondly, students already have a lot of stress in their lives, and adding more time to the school dab will only increase it. Students will have to juggle more responsibilities and manage their time more effectively, which can be overwhelming and stressful.

Thirdly, students will likely be less motivated to come to school if the know the have to spend more time there. This can lead to a decline in attendance and academic performance, as students may not feel as engaged or invested in their education.

Finally, adding more time to the school dab can be seen as unfair to students who already have a lot of responsibilities outside of school. Students may feel resentful of the extra time the have to spend in school and may be more likely to argue with teachers or school administrators about it.

In conclusion, while the idea of adding one and a half hour to the school dab may seem like a small change, I believe it will have a significant impact on students' daily lives and their ability to manage their time effectively. It is important for schools to consider the needs and wellbeing of their students when making decisions about their education.
