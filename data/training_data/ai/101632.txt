Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Key, guys, I'm going to be real with you. I think it's super not cool for students to commit to a career by the time they're in high school. Like, I get it, you want to have your whole life figured out and all that jazz, but let's be real, you're only like, 14 or 15! You don't know what you want to do with your life yet!

First, let's talk about age. Like, I'm not gonna lie, I'm still trying to figure out who I am and what I like. I'm still learning about different subjects in school, and I'm still trying to find my passion. Now am I supposed to know what I want to do for the rest of my life when I'm still trying to figure out who I am? It's like, crazy to think about committing to something so big when you're still trying to figure out who you are.

And don't even get me started on level of experience. Like, I've barely even had a part time job before! Now am I supposed to know what I'm good at or what I like doing when I haven't even tried anything yet? It's like, you have to take advantage of those summer camps and internships and stuff to figure out what you want to do. You can't just be like, "Oh, I'm going to be a doctor when I grow up," without even having any experience in the field.

And then there's the whole thing about being careless. Like, you're only in high school once, you know? You have to take advantage of all the opportunities you have and try new things. You never know what you might be good at or what you might enjoy. If you commit to a career too early, you might miss out on all these other cool things you could be doing.

For example, like, I'm really interested in photography right now. I've only been doing it for a little while, but I love it! If I had committed to being a doctor when I was in 8th grade
