His adventures sounded like something out of a movie, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the thought of traveling the world on a ship full of horses.

The Seagoing Cowboys program, which Luke was a part of, was established by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1945. The program's mission was to deliver livestock to countries in Europe and Asia that were struggling to recover from the devastation of World War II. Luke, who was just 18 at the time, joined the program as a way to fulfill his military draft duty while also seeing the world.

Over the course of two years, Luke completed nine missions, traveling to countries such as Greece, Italy, and China. He cared for hundreds of horses and other animals, ensuring they were healthy and happy during their journey across the ocean. Despite the challenges he faced, including nearly falling overboard during a storm, Luke loved every minute of his time as a seagoing cowboy.

One of the things that appealed most to me about Luke's story was the variety of destinations he visited. He saw the Acropolis in Greece, the Colosseum in Rome, and even visited the Great Wall of China. He experienced different cultures and ways of life, and learned to appreciate the beauty and diversity of the world.

But what struck me most about Luke's journey was the sense of purpose and fulfillment he felt. He was part of something bigger than himself, working to help people in need and make a positive impact on the world. He saw firsthand the difference that the Seagoing Cowboys program was making, and he felt proud to be a part of it.

As a 6th grader, I can't help but feel inspired by Luke's story. I want to have adventures like he did, to see the world and make a difference. And I know that I'm not alone - there are many other kids my age who feel the same way. That's why I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is something that we should all know about and consider.

Of course, it's not all adventure and excitement. There are challenges and dangers, just like there are in any journey. But the rewards are worth it. Luke's experiences as a seagoing cowboy shaped his life and broadened his worldview. He learned to appreciate different cultures and ways of life, and he gained a sense of purpose and fulfillment that he carried with him long after his time in the program ended.

So, if you're a kid like me who loves adventure and wants to make a difference, I encourage you to look into the Seagoing Cowboys program. It's not just a chance to see the world - it's a chance to be part of something bigger than yourself, to help people in need and make a positive impact. And who knows, you might just have the adventure of a lifetime.
