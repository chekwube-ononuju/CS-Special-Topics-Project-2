Traveling the World on the High Seas 

Growing up on a cattle station in rural Australia, I never imagined the adventures I would experience as a member of Seagoing Cowboys. This unique program allows us to experience life aboard tall ships while also helping with their operations. For anyone looking for an unforgettable adventure, I cannot recommend joining us highly enough.

There are so many reasons to sign up for this program. Firstly, you will visit places that most landlubbers never get to see. Vs the article mentioned, my voyages have taken me all around the Pacific and into ports rarely visited by tourists. I've anchored in tropical lagoons, walked untouched beaches, and explored bustling harbors in cultures very different from my own. Simply put, this program guarantees you will see more of the world than you ever thought possible in just a few short months at sea. 

Another major appeal is the chance to work aboard historic tall ships. Lending a hand with the sails, navigating by sextant under a canopy of stars, or preparing meals over an ancient galley stove there is no better way to experience sailing as it was centuries ago. The article talked about my role monitoring watches and steering the ship into new destinations. It was incredibly rewarding to be a working member of the crew and play a real part in the adventure.

Finally, the friendships made on these sail trips will last a lifetime. Living in such close quarters with other youth from around the world, we formed strong bonds despite our differences. The article mentioned some of my new" shipmates" hailing from places like Japan, Norway and Brazil. I am still in touch with many of them today thanks to the memories and experiences we shared. There truly is no better way to gain an appreciation for other cultures. 

In conclusion, if you want incredible stories, skills you'll use for a lifetime and international friends this program is for you. Join us for an adventure you'll never forget sailing aboard tall ships to places you never even dreamed of visiting. I guarantee the rewards will last far beyond your voyage.
