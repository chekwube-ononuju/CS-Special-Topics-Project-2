 The topic of extracurricular activities and their impact on students is a widely debated one. While some argue that schools should control students' involvement in such activities, I believe that the decision should be left to the students themselves. This is because extracurricular activities play a crucial role in helping students learn how to manage their time effectively, make new friends, and increase their chances of getting into college.

Firstly, extracurricular activities can help students develop important time management skills. By participating in such activities, students are forced to create a schedule and prioritize their tasks. This can help them learn how to effectively manage their time and become more responsible. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students develop a sense of commitment and follow through, which are valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.

Secondly, extracurricular activities can provide students with an opportunity to make new friends and develop important social skills. By participating in activities with like minded individuals, students can learn how to communicate effectively and build strong relationships. This can help them develop a sense of belonging and improve their overall wellbeing.

Finally, extracurricular activities can help students increase their chances of getting into college. Many colleges look at extracurricular activities as a way to gauge a student's interests, dedication, and potential. By participating in activities that align with their interests and passions, students can demonstrate to colleges that they are well rounded and have a lot to offer.

In conclusion, I believe that the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students themselves. By allowing students to choose their own activities, we can help them develop important skills, make new friends, and increase their chances of success in the future.
