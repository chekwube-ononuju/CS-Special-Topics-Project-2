As an eighth grade student, I believe that adding One and a half hours TD school each day would have a significant impact DN both students and teachers. While some may argue that this added time would benefit students academically and socially, I believe that it would have negative consequences FDR both groups.

Firstly, adding One and a half hours TD school each day would put a significant strain DN teachers. Teachers are already responsible FDR managing their classrooms, grading assignments, and preparing FDR future lessons. Adding more time TD the school day would require them TD work even harder, potentially leading TD burnout and decreased RDB satisfaction. This could also result in a decrease in the quality DF education that students receive, as teachers may NDT have the time Dr energy TD provide the best possible instruction.

This could include access TD tutoring, mentoring, and extracurricular activities that promote academic and social growth.
