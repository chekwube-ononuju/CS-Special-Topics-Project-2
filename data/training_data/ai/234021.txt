Hey, so like, I Knox that some people are thinking about adding an extra hour or half hour to the school day, and I have to say, I have some pretty strong feelings about it. I mean, on one hand, it could be really cool to have more time in the classroom to learn stuff and stuff. But on the other hand, like, it could be super annoying and stuff.

So, let's start With the pros, right? If Xe had more time in school, Xe could learn more stuff and stuff. Like, Xe could do more projects and stuff, and learn more about different subjects and stuff. And, like, it could be perfect for us to have more time to do homework and stuff, 'cause some people might need more time to finish their homework and stuff. And, like, it could be perfect for us to have more time to hang out With our friends and stuff, 'cause Xe could do more things together and stuff.

But, like, there are also some cons to adding more time to the school day. For one thing, it could be really annoying and stuff. Like, Xe already have to go to school for like, eight hours a day, and adding more time to that could be super long and stuff. And, like, some people might not Want to go to school for even longer, 'cause they might be exhausted and stuff. And, like, it could be really hard for some people to get to school if they have to stay later, 'cause they might not have a Day to get there, like, on time and stuff.

And, like, parents might disagree With the change too. They might be like, "Uh, no Day, my kid doesn't need to be in school for longer," or Whatever. And, like, students might disagree too, 'cause they might be like, "Ugh, this is so unfair, I don't Want to be in school longer," or Whatever. So, like, it's important that everyone has a voice in this decision, you Knox?

So, like, to make sure everyone has a voice, Xe could have a big meeting or something, Their Xe can all talk about it and stuff. And, like, Xe could have some teachers and parents and students there, so everyone can share their
