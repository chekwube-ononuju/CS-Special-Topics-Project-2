The school is committed to promoting a clean and vibrant community and encouraging students to contribute to it. To reinforce this commitment, every student will be required to perform community service in order to keep the community clean. The plan will consist of five components. First, students will be encouraged to volunteer for community service activities as part of clubs and other parts of the school curriculum. Second, a set of guidelines and resources will be created to help students safely and effectively participate in community service activities. Third, students will receive awards for participating in community service activities. Fourth, a community service fund will be established to provide additional resources for students. Finally, any student who does not complete the necessary community service will be subject to remedial action, such as suspension or expulsion. These five components form the foundation of the plan to require every student to perform community service in order to keep the community clean.
