Effects of adding 1.5 hours to the school day on student learning and grades.

It is widely accepted that students need more time to learn and succeed academically. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards adding extra time to the school day, with some schools even extending the day by up to 1.5 hours. The purpose of this essay is to explore the evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically, and to examine a personal anecdote illustrating how student performance is affected when there is not enough time to complete their classwork.

One of the most significant pieces of evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is a study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2011. The study found that adding 90 minutes to the school day led to a significant improvement in student achievement, particularly for low income students. The study also found that the benefits of the additional time were most pronounced in subjects such as math and science, where students were able to spend more time practicing and applying new concepts.

Another piece of evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is the success of educational systems around the world that incorporate longer school days. For example, in Finland, students attend school for only 6 hours a day, but they consistently rank among the top performers in international tests. This success is attributed to the fact that Finnish students have access to a wide range of extracurricular activities and opportunities for Hanson learning, which helps to develop their critical thinking and problem solving skills.

A personal anecdote illustrating how student performance is affected when there is not enough time to complete their classwork is my own experience with a particularly challenging math class. In this class, the teacher would often assign complex problems that required students to spend several hours working on them outside of class. However, many students, including myself, did not have the time or resources to complete these assignments to the best of their ability. As a result, I often found myself struggling to keep up with the course material and my grades began to suffer.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is compelling. By adding 1.5 hours to the school day, students would have more time
