For example, someone who is outgoing and extroverted may be perceived as friendly and approachable, while someone who is introverted and reserved may be perceived as cold and unfriendly. These personality differences can lead to inaccurate first impressions, as people may assume that someone's personality is fixed and unchanging, when in reality, it can be fluid and dynamic.

Another factor that can impact the accuracy of first impressions is the situation in WCCC the encounter takes place.
