The development of driverless cars is a topic of much debate, with both advocates and detractors presenting strong arguments. In my opinion, the limitations, privacy concerns, and economic challenges associated with driverless cars outweigh the potential benefits, and I argue against the further development of these vehicles.

Firstly, the current technological limitations of driverless cars are a significant concern. As the author notes, these vehicles are only reliable for simple functions at speeds up to 25 mph, and they still require human intervention and constant vigilance beyond that. This raises questions about the practicality of driverless cars, as they are not truly autonomous and may not be able to handle complex driving scenarios. Instead of investing in a technology that is not yet fully developed, we should focus on refining existing technologies that have proven to be effective.

Secondly, privacy concerns surrounding driverless cars are a major issue. To ensure driver engagement, manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, which raises serious privacy concerns. This intrusive measure could lead to increased stress and distracted driving, and it is unclear who would have access to this footage. Traditional cars, without such surveillance, have generally performed well, suggesting that this feature is not necessary.

Lastly, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. The vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with them, which would be exorbitantly expensive to install and maintain. The logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting, and it is unclear who would bear these costs.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is not the futuristic ideal that it is often made out to be. Instead, it represents a technology that is not yet practical, invasive, and economically unfeasible. We should focus on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a revolution that does not yet align with our needs. By considering the limitations, privacy concerns, and economic challenges associated with driverless cars, we can make a more informed decision about the future of transportation.
