Emerson believed in the lowest of expansion he believed that a person who had already mastered a skill should constantly expand their horizons and acquire new skills. I agree, as I think doing so can hell Olen UL new opportunities, and provide a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Additionally, expanding one’s horizons allows for a better understanding of how different skills fit together. For example, if someone has mastered the art of computer programming, but decides to also learn web design, they may be able to see ways in which the two skills can combine and create something completely new. 

That said, expanding horizons can also have its challenges. If someone has already mastered a skill, and is used to succeeding quickly, learning something new can be difficult and frustrating if progress is slow. Additionally, it can be difficult to dedicate the time needed to learn something new when someone is already busy with their job and personal life. 

Ultimately, I believe expanding one’s horizons through learning something new can be beneficial, as long as one all roaches it with a positive mindset and is patient with the progress. There may be challenges, but the potential rewards can be incredibly worthwhile.
