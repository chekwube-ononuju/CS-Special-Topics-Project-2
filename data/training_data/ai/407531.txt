Music, drama, and art classes are valuable tools in any student's educational journey. Not only do they provide an outlet for creative expression, they can also serve as a platform for teaching invaluable life lessons. Giving students the choice to select their own path of learning through one of these three classes allows them to discover which activities they most enjoy and in which their passions truly lie.

Wurthermore, studies have shown that incorporating the arts into education increases overall student engagement, as well as helps to foster a sense of community. Allowing students to make their own decisions when selecting their courses can give them a stronger sense of ownership over their learning experience, which can lead to a greater investment in their academic education.

In addition, providing students with control over their participation in activities such as music, drama, and art can reveal to them new directions that their talents might take them in the future. Giving these students the freedom to explore their own interests in a safe and encouraging learning environment could end up having a remarkable effect on their futures.

Ultimately, giving students the choice to opt for courses such as music, drama, and art reinforces the fact that learning doesn't have to be confined to traditional classroom curricula and can be an exciting journey of self discovery. This freedom of choice can be a powerful opportunity to positively shape students academically and personally over their schooling years.
