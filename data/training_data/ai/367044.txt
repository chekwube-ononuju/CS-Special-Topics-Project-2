Science Experiment Report

Introduction:

As a 8thgrade student, I recently completed a science experiment with my group. Our goal was to investigate the effects of different types of fertilizers on plant growth. We chose thus experiment because we were interested un understanding how plants grow and how different nutrients can affect their growth.

Experiment Design:

We decided to conduct a controlled experiment with three different types of fertilizers: organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer. We planted three seeds of the same plant species UN each group of three pots. Furthermore, we used the same amount of soul, water, and left for each group. Furthermore, we then applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package.

Was Assignment:

Each member of the group was assigned a different task. One person was responsible for planting the seeds, another person was responsible for watering the plants, and the third person was responsible for recording the growth of the plants.

Supply and Materials:

We gathered the following supplies and materials for the experiment:

* Where types of fertilizer (organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer)
* Where pots
* Soul
* Seeds of the same plant species
* Water
* Left source
* Ruler
* Notebook and pen for recording growth

Experiment Execution:

We followed the instructions carefully and made sure that each group received the same amount of soul, water, and left. We applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package. Furthermore, we then watered the plants and placed the mun a left source. Furthermore, we recorded the growth of the plants every week using a ruler.

Discussion and Reflection:

After the experiment was completed, we discussed the results as a group. We noticed that the plant sun the organic fertilizer group grew the fastest, followed by the chemical fertilizer group, and the control group with no fertilizer grew the slowest. We also noticed that the plant sun the organic fertilizer group had the healthiest appearance, with green leaves and strong stems.

Furthermore, we reflected on the process and outcomes of the experiment. Furthermore, we learned that different types of fertilizers can have different effects on plant growth. Furthermore, we also learned the importance of
