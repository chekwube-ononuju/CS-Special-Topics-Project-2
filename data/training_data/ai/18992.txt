Taking classes from home can be an advantageous and time-saving experience for students during these unique times, but it does have its drawbacks. From the perspective of those who have taken online classes, the greatest benefit is the flexibility it provides. Students can do their work at anytime they choose and automatically save from having to make a trip from school to home and the other way around. This can also save time by not having to wait in between classes. 

On the other hand, a significant disadvantage can be the potential for distractions. It is much more difficult for students to stay focused and complete their work when taking classes from home since there could be various distractions such as television, family members, pets, etc. As well, if a student does not have enough motivation, taking classes online can lead to procrastination and be detrimental to learning.
