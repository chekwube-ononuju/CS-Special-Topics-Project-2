When it comes to the purpose of a university education, there are many opinions out there. Some people believe that a university education is primarily intended to prepare students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions as well. There are many reasons to believe that a university education can have both employment-oriented and non-employment-oriented functions.

One reason a university education can have employment-oriented functions is because many university graduates go on to have successful careers in various industries. For example, law graduates often end up becoming lawyers, business graduates often end up becoming business executives, and engineering graduates often end up becoming engineers. This is due, in part, to the fact that university graduates often have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in these industries.

On the other hand, a university education can also have non-employment-oriented functions. For example, university graduates often have opportunities to engage in intellectual activity, explore new cultures, and learn new skills. These opportunities allow university graduates to develop their skills and knowledge in a variety of ways, which can be beneficial in their future careers.

Overall, there are many reasons to believe that a university education can have both employment-oriented and non-employment-oriented functions. These functions are often beneficial for university graduates in terms of their careers, and they offer a variety of opportunities for intellectual growth and enjoyment.
