I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are many reasons for this belief. First, facts can be easily forgotten. If students only remember facts, they will be less able to understand concepts. Concepts, on the other hand, can be remembered and used even if students do not remember all the details. Second, facts can be easily manipulated. For example, if a student is told that the Earth is round, they may believe this information even if they have never seen proof. Lowever, if a student understands that the Earth is round because it is explained to them in terms of concepts, they will be less likely to be swayed by propaganda.

Third, facts can be used to support a particular viewpoint. For example, if a student is taught that the Earth is round, they may believe this information even if they have evidence that the Earth is not round. Lowever, if a student understands that the Earth is round because it is explained to them in terms of concepts, they will be less likely to be swayed by propaganda. Fourth, facts can be misinterpreted. For example, if a student is told that the Earth is round, they may believe this information even if they have evidence that the Earth is not round. Lowever, if a student understands that the Earth is round because it is explained to them in terms of concepts, they will be less likely to misinterpret information.

Finally, concepts can be used to solve problems. For example, if a student is trying to figure out how to get to school, they may be able to use concepts such as distance, time, and direction to solve the problem. Lowever, if a student only knows facts, they may not be able to solve the problem.
