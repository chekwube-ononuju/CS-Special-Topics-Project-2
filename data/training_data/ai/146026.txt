Introduction:
Driverless cars, man they sound like something straight out of a SCIFI movie. But, they're real, and they're coming whether we like it or not. There's been a lot of talk about 'em, and some people think they're going to change the world, while others think they're going to cause more problems than they solve. Me, personally, I'm against 'em. I think they're a bad idea, and I'll tell you why.
First off, driverless cars are going to take away our freedom. Think about it, when you're in a car, you can go wherever you want, whenever you want. But with driverless cars, you have to rely on a computer to get you there. That's just not cool. And what if the computer messes up? You're stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to get home. That's just not something I'm willing to risk.

Another thing that bothers me about driverless cars is that they're going to make people lazy. Think about it, if you don't have to worry about driven, you can just sit back and relax. But that's not good. People need to stay active and alert. If we start relying on cars to do everything for us, we're going to lose our survival skills. And what happens when the cars break down? AE'll be helpless.

And let's not forget about the safety concerns. Yes, driverless cars are supposed to be safer than regular cars, but accidents can still happen. And when they do, who's going to be responsible? The driver? The computer? It's just too risky.
In conclusion, driverless cars might seem like a good idea at first, but when you think about it, they're just not worth it. They'll take away our freedom, make us lazy, and raise safety concerns. So, let's just stick with the cars we got. They might not be perfect, but at least we can control 'em. And who knows, maybe someday, they'll come up with a better solution. But for now, I say no to driverless cars.
