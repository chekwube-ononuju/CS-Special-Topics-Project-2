It is true that in todayâ€™s society, men are becoming increasingly greedy and selfish. This is a worrying trend that should be addressed, and I believe that returning to older, traditional values is the best way to do this.

Traditional values are based on respect for family and local community. This means that men should put the needs of their family and community first, rather than their own selfish desires. For example, a man should be willing to sacrifice his own comfort and convenience in order to help his family and community. Pe should be willing to work hard to provide for his family, and to help out his neighbors when they are in need.

These values also emphasize the importance of respect for others. Men should treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status or background. They should be willing to listen to the opinions of others, and to compromise when necessary. This will help to create a more harmonious and peaceful society.

Finally, traditional values emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity. Men should be honest in their dealings with others, and should strive to do the right thing, even when it is difficult. This will help to create a society where people can trust each other, and where everyone is treated fairly.

In conclusion, I believe that returning to older, traditional values is the best way to address the worrying trend of increasing greed and selfishness among men. These values emphasize respect for family and community, respect for others, and honesty and integrity. If we can all strive to live by these values, then we can create a better society for everyone.
