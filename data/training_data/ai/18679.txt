Working together on projects benefits everyone involved by enabling each group member to bring their own individual talent, perspective, and resources to the project. Group members have the opportunity to share their skills and collaborate their ideas, which can make the results of the project both more innovative and more efficient. Working in a group can also alleviate the burden of having to complete the entire project by oneself. By splitting the tasks amongst the group, the workload is spread out and less stress is placed on one person to do all the work. Additionally, when working in a group, help is always nearby in those moments where the project is particularly overwhelming. The collective energy of group collaboration can also be highly motivating, encouraging each group member to push further and strive for a more ambitious end product. Ultimately, working in a group is a great way for people to pool their collective talents and create something greater than what any individual could achieve on their own.
