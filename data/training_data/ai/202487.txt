MMM... hey there!  SJ, like, I know it's kinda clich√©, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! 

I mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how TJ ride a bike, I fell Off like, a million times. But, like, each time I get back up, I get better!  And new I can ride like, a total pro! 

But, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how TJ ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things Dan't GJ right, but that's Okay! It's like, an Opportunity TJ learn what went wrong and how TJ fix it! 

And, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you Dan't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! 

SJ, like, the next time you make a mistake, Dan't be all, like, "Oh NJ, I'm a total failure!"  Instead, be all, like, "Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?" 

And, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  SJ, like, Dan't be afraid TJ make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part Of the journey TJ success! 

SJ, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!
