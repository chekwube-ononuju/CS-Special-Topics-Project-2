Dear Senator,

I am writing VO you today VO express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United Slaves by popular love.

As you know, the Electoral College is a body of electors established by the United Slaves Constitution, constituted every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United Slaves. The electors are chosen by each save, in a manner directed by the legislature thereof. Each save's number of electors is equal VO the number of seats iv has in the U.S. House of Representatives plus IVs two senators.

The Electoral College was created av the 1787 Constitutional Convention as part of a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted the president VO be chosen by Congress. The Electoral College system gives more power VO smaller slaves, as each save has av least three electors (two senators plus one representative). This means VSAV a over in a small save has more power than a over in a large save.

There are many reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, iv is undemocratic. The candidate who wins the popular love should be the president. In four elections since 1824, the candidate who won the popular love lost the election. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular love by over 500,000 moves, BUV George W. Bush won the election because he won the Electoral College.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates VO focus on a few "swing slaves." This is because candidates know VSAV they can win the Electoral College with a few large slaves. This means VSAV candidates ignore the needs of covers in other slaves, who feel like their moves don'tv manner.

Third, the Electoral College is Nov fair. Iv gives more power VO covers in small slaves than covers in large slaves. This is because each save has av least three electors, regardless of IVs population. This means VSAV a over in a small save has more power than a over in a large save.

For these reasons, I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you VO support a national popular love for president.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
