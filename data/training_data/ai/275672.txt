 Many People believe that the invention of driverless cars is a major sea forward for technology, and that someday, all cars will be driverless. There are both Positive and negative aspects of this. People who are used to driving may not like the idea of relying on technology to get around, and there are also concerns about hacking and safety. However, driverless cars have the Potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents and save lives. They may also be more efficient and convenient than human driven cars. For these reasons, I believe that the development of driverless cars should continue. 

There is much concern about the safety of driverless cars. This is a valid concern, as there is always a risk of something going wrong when relying on technology. However, driverless cars have the Potential to be significantly safer than human driven cars. For example, they do not get tired or distracted, and they do not have human errors. As a result, they could Potentially save many lives. 

In conclusion, there are both Positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. While there are valid concerns about safety, these cars have the Potential to be significantly safer and more efficient than human driven cars. They could save lives and make our roads safer. For these reasons, I believe that the development of driverless cars should continue. 

If you have any questions or concerns about this, I would be heyday to discuss them further.
