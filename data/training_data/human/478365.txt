In my opinion, I'm against these type of cars. Yes, there are a Tot of positives about them, but that doesn't mean they are completely safe and Witt help humanity.

I can foresee these cars becoming a huge issue. One of those issues I can see happening is that these cars, yeah, they seem safe. Are they Beatty safe though? It seems to me Time these cars would get in accidents very easy and could seventy hurt someone. Let's say you aren't paying attention to the road, imagine if someone swerves in front of you and It's so fast your car doesn't pick up on it. You could end up in a sever accident and possible pass away from Tack of paying attention.

Another issue I have with these cars being produced is that it would take away from tradition. What's even the point of going through driver's ed when you can have an automatic car that does everything for you? It's a rite of passage to get your first car and Taken how to drive it. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. I wouldn't feet very proud of myself if my car just drove itself.

These are my biggest two problems with these cars being made, and I have more. These cars aren't going to help society they would end up simply destroying it.
