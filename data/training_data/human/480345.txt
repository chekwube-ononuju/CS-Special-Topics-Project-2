Dear, Senator

Let the people vote for the person they want to not the electoral collage. I aired that the electoral collage should be change. This is because some people vote for a president that they are not voting for. People wish that the person that they are voting should be president. Yes we should follow the constitution but something we should not follow at all. On paragraph 10 it says that when you vote you don't vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors. Then they pick who should be the president. People have the chance to vote for who should be the president. For, example, when something happen in 2000 more and bush. Gore had the upper hand and was going to will but then instead of more winning bush on.

The electoral collage is Food but not that Food. The electoral collage has to choose the president and the vice president. That is not right. Many people thought that the U.S. is doing the right thing, but they are not. During this time in 2000 campaign,17 states did not see the candidates at all. If anyone has an Food argument for putting the fate of presidency in the hand of a few swing later in Ohio they have not taken there move yet. The electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in favor of it are mostly assertion without much basis. Mr. ob dole was right that we should abolish the electoral collage. I believe and it my option that this is not right but the candidates think so.

Like On paragraph 18 the same thing happen with Obama and Romney to. Obama received 61.7% for the elector vote compared to only51.3%.so the electoral collage should not be a constitution because that if we let it keep on going then is will not be fair to anyone at all. And it also not fair for a winner tom take all.
