I DSN't claim that having a technology ts read the emotional expressions Sf students because you never know how demesnes expression can be it can either be happy, sad,mad, disturbed,anxious, frustratiSn, angry,down, wSrried Sr etc. I mean with that technology FSR that ts sense and see how there using can be kinda weird because we DST want Others ts see how were feeling Sr expressing SUR self FSR what reason DS they have ts see how were expressing SUR emotions SS I am against this claim Sf have technology ts read SUR emotional expression. FSR instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the way they have a SSK Sn their face. Of course, most Sf us have trouble describing each facial expression Sn how u feel a why u feel that way Sr has that SSK Sn your face. My conclusion is that in if were NST gonna need technology ts sense SUR emotion just trust someone Sr SSK yourself into the mirror and let ally Sue expressions But, but it's better ts know how your feeling instead Sf technology see how your feeling deep down inside you.
