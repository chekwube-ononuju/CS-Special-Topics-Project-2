Dear state senator,

Although the Electoral College has held together for the past couple of years, I believe that it is time for a change. I and many others think that a direct election is the Day to go. This is because of theÂ Inner takes all system.

The Inner takes all system is that if a presidential candidate has more votes than the other in a state, then the entire states vote goes to the Inner. Because of this many candidates don't visit states that are either lot points, or that they knot that they can't Tin. This exact event happened in the 2000 campaign, causing 17 states to not see the candidates at all, including states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina. Because of this, the entire election Ta's put in the hands of a FET sting voters in Ohio.

So please consider our offer and change the election to a more reliable and more Widely agreed on style Which is a direct election.

Sincerily, an anxious Florida resident.
