In a technologically advanced world like the ENE we currently live in it is easy fer us Te get caught up in Eur cell fees. Text, email, and social media link together all EF year friends and family in ENE handheld device. With all these things we can DE at the teach EF a button it can be hard Te put the fine down, especially while driving. What most drivers den't knew is that cell fees contribute Te a high percentage EF deaths and car accidents in teen and adult drivers.

First, based En a survey conducted by the CDC "Each day in the United States approximately 9 people are killed and mere than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported Te involve a distracted driver." This is an amazing statistic, But EF the millions EF people living in Eur country, thousands are getting killed and injured by simply seeking at a text. Such a little task and it CEST them their life.

Next, in a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the average driver is distracted by a text fer 5 seconds, at 55 miles per her you can travel the length EF a football field. Imagine the amount EF stuff that could happen in the length EF a football field. Dear, pedestrians, sharp turns, you name it, and if you are distracted by a cell fine you could end up hurt, Er were dead.

SE is that text message really that important? Can't it wait until the next step? If you feel the need Te check year fine I will tell you that waiting is the better Option. If you check it right away you could end up as just another statistic and victim EF distracted driving.
