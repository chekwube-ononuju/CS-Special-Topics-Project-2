PROPER_NAME

Dear Senator,

I'm PROPER_NAME, writing you to ask if you could change the Electoral Collage, I'm sure I'm beside hundred asking for the same. Instead of voting for our slate of electors, we prefer to vote for the president himself. I have reasons, I will be glad to sure them with you.

In my opinion, I believe the Electoral collage is not fair. The bigger states get a lot more electoral vote, So it's obvious if the president wins all the bigger states their going to win. The way I see it, is that the little states don't matter, or they aren't as important, since they got little electoral votes. For example, If I was running for president my main goal would be to win all the bigger states first, like; California, Texas, Florida. With them three states I already have 122 electron votes, That's when I'll start focusing on getting my other 148 votes by winning the little states over.

My other reason why myself, and hundred would rather vote for the president himself be, because of the mistakes of voting for the wrong candidate. Remember in 1960, Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress? What will happen? If you think about it anything and everything could go wrong!

Lastly, Eoting for the president himself would be easier, You along with others in your range would not have to worry about the electoral votes. Not only that it may also be less stressful, and crazier. Enters like my parents would not get confuse for voting the wrong elector, and giving her vote to the wrong candidate.

In conclusion, I honestly think not having the electoral votes would be best for our voters. I'm sure the candidates would enjoy us the voters making the mistake and voting for the wrong elector, since at the end of the day the Candidate is the one getting the vote, that wasn't meant for him. Instead of voting for our electors, why won't we vote straight to our president?

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
