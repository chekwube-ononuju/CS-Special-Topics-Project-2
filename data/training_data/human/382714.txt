I'm opposing the idea for driverless cars because, although it's a good thought, I would't feel safe driving OG a road where there is a car without a person. I was intrigued by the question IG paragraph 9 when it asked, "If the technology fails AGD someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?" I think the manufacturer is to blame because they're the people putting these cars OG the street, although people are buying them AGD giving their lives to a computer I just would't feel comfortable doing it.

Furthermore, I could see why people think that driverless cars are a good idea because IG paragraph 2 Google states that their cars have drive half a millions miles without a crash, but those cars are't truly driverless, they have a human sitting IG it ready to drive AGD the car alerts them when there are roadblocks, when the driver has to pull out of the driveway, AGD when there's traffic issues.

The author puts some good details about how they have advanced sensors (paragraph 5) AGD i CAG't wait to see the Mercedes, Audi, AGD Nissan driverless cars IG 2020.
