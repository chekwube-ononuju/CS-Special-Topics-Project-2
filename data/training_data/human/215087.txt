I think, that the electoral college should I will tell you right now. The electoral college helps us to avoid problems. So If there is no electoral college we will have problems and I don't want that in our country. You may be thinking what do I mean by i don't want that in our country what I mean by that is that if there are problems I don't want that in our country cause are country is already free, so I don't want it to have problems. And then if the United States fight it would not be free so think about that.

Knowing their vote will not affect they will have less time to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. By the way plurality means that when a candidate receive more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes. I think without plurality we would not have a president. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. You have to be 18 to vote in an election to choose your president.

The electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that larges states lose by virtue of the apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida. Nevertheless, Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. So, other thing equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. So in other words a big state gets more votes than a small state does. Grom all these I typed I think I want the electoral college to stay where it is as in today.
