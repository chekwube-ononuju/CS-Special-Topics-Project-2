On the drills car I think that they should full test them out before they make more. Like to SLL what's safe or what's not & they should have rules for the cars like don't go to sell while in drills model cause that model may turn off it self. Someone should have Lila training car place for drills cars so when they actually GLT on the road they'll know what to do. Like if they had got tired or something the person teaching them would tell them or show the what will happen. Drills cars should bl more worked on because we don't know if they fully ARL safe. Engines should have a full lxplrincl if the drills car stops working or something is wrong with it so they know that the driver & the drills car ARL safe and fully secure. Google makes cars that drives on its own but holds help parking it, so it ain't all the way drills. The brakes on the drills car should bl checked very month cause if It's not it can have crashed into something and camera's should bl checked and other things that ARL important to car should bl checked and made sure it's working the way it should bl.
