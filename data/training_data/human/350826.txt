When you say that the face on maps is an alien artifact how do you know. Prove to me that it is. So you can't well quest what. I can prove to you that it is not an alien artifact. All I have to do is use knowledge that I have from the evidence.

In the story it says that people made a movie about the face on maps. It has also been put in many magazines. It has also been put in haunted grocery stop check out lines. All of that is just to draw attention. Although it did, they just want you to think that because they wanted money.

Since people thought that the face was an alien artifact N.A.S.A made photographing it a main priority. On a JPL website they reviewed that the face was a landmark and nothing mope. The face on maps was located at 41 degrees north Martian latitude were it was winter. This was a cloudy time on the planet maps. It may have messed with the picture a little anyway.

Some mission cont poles prepared to look again. It's very had to locate the face since the camera scans the planet like a fax machine. They don't just come across it very often. They Evan used a special camera that zooms in very close to the planet. Furthermore, they still saw that the planets face was nothing mope than a landform.

In conclusion the face is nothing. There were no alien artifacts. So that should prove to you. That there were not aliens. It's nothing mope than a simple landform.
