Summer projects should be student designed, because it's Summer break, most student's won't be doing work. They are most likely to be outside in the pool, at the park and playing sports. But because of that students should be required to work on the project at least once a week every week until the due date of the project.

Working on a student designed project could be more beneficial and encourage creativity and inspire many great idea's. Because during Summer break because during break student's have more time and more creativity and inspiration, especially when its student designed, every project would be unique and different according to the type of summer the student had, If they had a happy fun, filled summer the project could be fun and playful but if the student had a laid back and chill summer the project could reflect that and being chilled and laid back.

It could also prevent cheating, and expose cheater's. As if two students come back to school with the same project its most likely they cheated. Because what's most likely going to happen is the students who don't do any work will cheat and copy off of the students who took valuable time out of their summer. So student designed projects could eliminate the problem of cheating and copying.

In the end I find student designed projects are better and more beneficial than teacher designed projects, as student projects are more creative and more inspiring for the student's.
