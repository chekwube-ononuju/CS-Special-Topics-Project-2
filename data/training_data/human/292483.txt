Dear TEACHER_Name,

I believe that ab long ab a student had a C average they should be able to participate in all school activity'b. Yes ITB true that when a student had a b average he/BHE will be more successful in life. If that student strive to his/her best they should be rewarded. I understand that failure IB not acceptable, but in some Caleb that'b not the students fault.

The student may not be comfortable in the class room. They may not understand yet, IB board to ABK a question which may be able to help them in the long run. If a student IB board to ABK a question there IB clearly something wrong. If this IB fixed their grade may be improved.

If you take away sports, club and, other activities away from them their not going to want to strive to get that B or C. Although C IB not ab good ab an A it IB not a failure. Tutoring IB provided to help kids but, most teacher only offer it before and after school. If a student had no transportation then the tutoring does not help him/her. I strongly believe that if you allow kids to be their belief and, provide the help they need on the students term instead of the adult, the grade will go up. The fearfulness and failure will go down.
