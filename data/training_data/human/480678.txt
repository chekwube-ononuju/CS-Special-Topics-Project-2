Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definitely is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976, I must say, it certainly did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similar to the ones around the American West. It is really just the Martian equivalent to those particular landforms. The two are so similar in formation and shape.

The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it were some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is nothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height OS the Face on Mars.

It was very hard work just to try and Get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definitely no "Martian Made" structure. We Got very close on a very clear day, and you can defined see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a disappointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benefit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would Give the taxpayers evidence and reason to support us and Give us their money to support the cause. SO I rest my case THT clearly we are not lying because it would benefit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't.
