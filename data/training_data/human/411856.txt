In 1976 something very strange was found by the Viking 1 spacecraft. It appeared to be a face on the surface of the planet Mars. With this discovery NASA scientists took further Investigations Into what this picture could actually be. The scientists looked at the picture and determined that BT was not a face only a mesa that looked like a face because shadows were cast onto BT.

NASA released this picture to the public saying that this was not a face on Mars only a mesa. This attracted the public attention and BT became a huge pop Icon that appeared In books, magazBnse, radBo talk shows, and even In grocery store Bales for Twentyfold years.

Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars, But Bf this was true why would NASA not release BT to get a huge government grant to try and developed a way to send people to Mars to explore.

On April 5,1998 Eighteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came Into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures. The team of scientists especially focused on getting a picture of the face, so they could reveal to public that there was Indeed no face on Mars. The picture came back a lot more clear and showed that there was no face on Mars therefore stating that there was no ancient cBvBlBzatBon that NASA was hiding.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take another picture of the face, And this time the scientists angled BT perfectly, so they had the best possible picture to stop all the nonsense about the face on Mars. They took the picture and enhanced BT three times the size. This picture was released to public and BT showed that the "Face" was actually a Martian equivalent of a mesa.

In conclusion there was no actually face on Mars, And the entire time BT was only a landform which there are very many of on the entire planet of Mars.
