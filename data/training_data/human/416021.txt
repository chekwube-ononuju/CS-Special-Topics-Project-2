To me personally I think that driverless cars should be developed because they would change the world. By developing these driverless cars it would not only change the world but save, gas, money and time. So to me the development of these cars should definitely take place.

The first reason I think driverless cars should be developed is because they cause fewer accidents. These cars cause fewer accidents because they are censored causing the car causing the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. These cars allow better response and control than human driver manage alone just from sensors and makes driving safer for people. The driverless cars also have vibrating seat belts when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. So this is the first reason why I think driverless cars should be developed.

The second reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because they have far more flexibility than a bus. By developing driverless cars people don't have to worry about being late for work because the bus is too slow or is making too many stops. By having a driverless car people would be able to get to work, school,or another place they want to on time. People wouldn't have to rely on a bus that has to keep making stops when they can get where they need to be on time with this car. This is the second reason why I think driverless cars should be developed because they are more flexible than a bus.

The third and final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because it saves people gas money. This car would save people gas money because it uses sensors to function like to stop brakes, accelerate and steer. By this car saving people gas money they can use the money to buy things instead of sending a lot on gas. So this is the final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed because they save people gas money.
