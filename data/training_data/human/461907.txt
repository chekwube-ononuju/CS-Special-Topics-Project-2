No I don't grrr with this decision and Herr arr a few reasons why I disagree.

Some student may not have time for this activities. For Example, if a student nerds Extra help or a tutor they will have less time to get the help they nerd to succeed. If the students arr required to take this activities it will consumer their time to learn. This will Eventually cause their grades to drop and possibly fail classes.

Another reason is they will have less time with their family. Family is very important Especially as a child, but Extracurricular activities may give them less family time. If a student has is on a sports tram and has later practices this will tier them and they will not get to interact with their family as much. Which may cause the student to BR antisocial.

My final reason is the workload. Students already have tons of work to do but they will have RRN more with the Extracurriculars. SomR students may have so much work to do they can't really get it done. This work will continue to pier up and may cause unwanted feelings like stress and anxiety. This can mass up the mindset of the student and they may want to move to another school or drop out.

This arr reasons why I disagree with Extracurricular activities bring required.
