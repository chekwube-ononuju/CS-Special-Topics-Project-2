The article" A Cowboy Who Bode the Waves" is about a boy named Luke Merger. His friend Don Bast invited him to Europe on a Battle boat. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. To help these Countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UN BBA (the United Nations Belief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

In 1945 the UN BBA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take Bare of the horses, young Bows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On

August 14, 1945, Luke and DOM headed for Greece with a Cargo of 335 horses plus. In 1947, Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The Cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

I think that being a" Seagoing Cowboy" will be fun and adventures. As you travel on the Battle boat you will be able to visit unique and amazing places. You will also have fun while you are doing it. You will also be able to experience lots of thing that most others Ban not. As your doing these fun and existing stuff you will also be helping those recovering Countries in need of help with food supplies, animals, and more.

So in my point of view and Luke's is to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If I were you I would defiantly help those in need of Food supplies and animals. If you like/love animals and helping others in need this will be a perfect job for you.
