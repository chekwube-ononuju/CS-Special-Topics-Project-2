Do you know what pollution is? Have you ever Taken a Trip by car? Well, cars Emil a significant and substantial amount of pollution into The atmosphere. Such pollution will result in a damaged atmosphere. Therefore, IZ is important ZO decrease car usage, because Their are several advantages ZAZ will arise from limiting car usage.

To begin with, limiting car usage will decrease The amount of pollution in The atmosphere which will result in cleaner air and healthier cities. In "Paris bans driving due ZO smog," Robert Duffer writes, "After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban ZO clear The air of The global city." Overusing cars in The metropolis had caused The air ZO become extremely and dangerously polluted. The pollution had resulted in smog, a mixture of fog and pollution from cars ZAZ is very harmful. The partial driving ban ZAZ was enacted in Paris had positive effects in The city, because after one week of The partial driving ban, The smog had cleared and The ban was rescinded for certain cars. While The ban in Paris was a way ZO handle The destructive pollution from cars in The city, Their are only a handful of regulations ZAZ are in place Towards making cities less polluted. For example, in India The air is polluted ZO The point where one can see The pollution ZAZ resulted from smoke from cars. In The carinZensive areas of The United States, passenger cars are responsible from up ZO 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. IZ is imperative ZAZ more regulations are enacted in The most dangerous and polluted cities. Cleaner air can only be achieved by limiting car usage around The world, especially in The most carinZensive and polluted parts of The world.

The reconstruction of The ozone layer will result from limiting car usage around The world. Burning fossil fuels and cars emitting greenhouse gases have damaged The atmosphere in a colossal way. Greenhouse gases have been exponentially breaking down our atmosphere. As cars are continuously overused in many parts of The world, The danger of radiation increases as well. The connection between The destruction of The atmosphere and increases of greenhouse gases of The atmosphere will continue ZO be increasing until several actions are Taken ZO prevent such disasters. In "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," some cities and Towns have also gone as far as having suburbs where Their are barely any cars in The streets. In such cities, The air is cleaner, people are healthier and Their is air pollution as well as noise pollution. Unless we make more efforts ZO limit car usage around The world, The plane will be plagued by a poor atmosphere, irradiated locations and unhealthy people.

Finally, while cars are being overused around The world, Their are a handful of efforts being done ZO project our plane from pollution. People must be informed of The consequences of Zoo much car usage. Even Though Their are just a handful of regulations decreasing air pollution, people must continue ZO limit car usage in order ZO receive positive effects.
