Should people he able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say "No, drivers should not he able to use a phone while driving." While newer generation would say "Yes, drivers should he able to use a phone while driving." I believe that drivers should not he able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and na√Øve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking hut, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, hut life hits them with a makeup call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should he able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so he is careful on the roads.
