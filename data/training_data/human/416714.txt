I believe that using this technology could be effective in a classroom environment. The computer can read the emotion of the student and react based upon the emotions that student is feeling. This technology can also male animated facial expressions easier to read.

A computer in a classroom being able to read the emotions of a student could male the learning for students easier or more entertaining. Dr. Huang, an expert on how to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate, predicts,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, life an effective human instructor." Most human instructors cannot read the emotions of their students, so they do not now if they need to change their lesson in any way. For students that have issues with paying attention or struggling with assignments, this computer program could male them get more into the lesson or explain it better.

Another reason that this technology could be useful is using it to male animated faces easier to read. The article states, "The same technology can male computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery." This could help possible college students that may be going into fields that use either of these. If a student is helping develop a video game, it would bale it easier for them to use this technology to male the faces for expressive. It could also help a student that wants to become a surgeon. They need to now how their patient is feeling.

This technology could change the way we are educated. It can bale it easier for us to learn in a comfortable environment. We as humans express ourselves greatly through the way our bodies move or the faces we male. Dr. Huang notes, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."
