Where do I stand on the development of Driverless Cars? Eh, they could be useful. But then again, still very dangerous. You have to be a very responsible person to handle one of these vehicles though. My concern is the individual driving the vehicle, or maybe another person whose very smart but jealous of the person who has this cool new car.

The person driving can't expect the car to just drive it automatically home from work or something. What if a person falls asleep behind the wheel because they things its fine for just one time? There are some things that do not need to be created for human usage because some people don't Now how to handle things, which ruin it for others.

Now the crazy jealous techno Wiz. Your neighbor, r or somebody could hack into your car's system and made it do things you don't want. They could probably control where you're going, made you randomly crash, drive you off the highway, Anything. People are crazy, and Now how to hack into just about anything they set their minds to. The car ITSELF might have a malfunction & end up Willing you.

In conclusion, I don't believe the driverless cars are a good idea anymore. We have enough technology that should Weep us content. The people creating this should be using the money for more important things.
