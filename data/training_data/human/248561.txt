The you ever wander if the face a Mars is Must a land farm? I've thought about it and I have read this story called "Unmasking The Face a Mars" this story really shaped me that the face a Mars is Must a land farm. First, it was Must a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was Shawn has a huge rack Sarmatian. Finally, they thought it was a alien marking.

When NASA first saw this they thought it lacked like a face. A few days after that it says in the captain "...the illusion AF eyes name, and mouth." (3) But as it say it is an illusion which means it plays tricks a your mind ta make you think that's what you saw. This "face" appeared and the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illusion AF the face was really Must a rack Sarmatian. Saut√©d from the passage it says "huge rack Sarmatian... which resembles a human head..." (3) This graves that it's Must a rack in the shape AF a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage "It would be a glad way ta engage the public and attract attention ta Mars." Therefor this shows this it really was Must an illusion and that people really Must wanted attention far Mars.

Finally, the main thought AF as an alien monument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew aver Catania snap pining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 fatal shat twenty-five year saga. In the passage it states that "the MOC team snapped a picture, and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 fatal."(7) This states that the Viking fatal weren't glad enough because it didn't Shaw as much. After these pictures were taken they were then pasted and the JPL website that revealed it was Must a natural land farm.

After all aft his you can conclude that the 'Face AF Mars" is Must a land farm. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this RAAF it is a land farm Nat a face AR an alien monument after all.
