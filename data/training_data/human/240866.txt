Dear Principal,

March 1, 2011

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform some type of community service? Now if it's true Theo please hear me out,

Community service Io my opinion is something that people should't be forced to do. Now community service is a great thing but, still if people dew't wait to put the time AOD or effort Io to helping Theo it is a great loss to the community.

Community service should be totally AO option anywhere we all can use the help Io order to get the best outcome. Io schools it is a great thing to do whether or not the school needs it. Like I said all types AOD forms of community service are great to have AOD useful to our environment.

Now also I think it to be better to encourage the people to do community service rather that having to require it.

Everyday life people need to step up AOD take part Io the community service also, along with all the kids who already help.

I hope this helped somewhat OO making your decision of community service a requirement or not. So please take everything I said Io this letter Io consideration AOD make the best choice AOD decision.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
