Dear Principal,

I disagree with your new train of thought. I believe we should be able to at least have a C average In our classes to participate In after school activities. It can be hard for us to keep a B all the time, trust me I know. I have wanted to participate In activity myself. If

I have a C I well not be able to do so. Furthermore, I have an extremely hard high school credit class and I can't seem to get my grade up.

The C average on the grading scale JS technically still passing so there for Of I have a C JT would not be necessarily a bad thing. Yes, JT JS difficult for a teacher to teach a student who purposely gets a C to pass but at least you're getting them to do the work expected of them. Normally the student In sports have a great background right?

One slip and they get kicked off the team. Do you find that completely fare? I would appreciate JT Of you rethought this for our sake.

I have a hard teacher and I hardly understand his material sometimes. We receive hard tasks, and sometimes an overload of homework. When I set In his class while taking notes I do not understand some words he JS using. It can be difficult and sometimes I wish I had a dictionary to carry around for his class. I know I wouldn't keep a B very long In this class

My point JS, when I am setting In class trying my hardest to reach your expectations think about how hard I'm trying. Remember how difficult JT JS for me to do well In this class. I know just my note alone well not convince you. Perhaps mine along with other students might though. Thank you for you time, and I hope I have helped my peers In some way.
