First, If I was a scientist at NASA talking to others about them truly believing the Face wasn't created by aliens. I would tell them aliens are not real in the world we live in today. I would also tell them that if aliens was real they would not be able to create Faces. Furthermore, I would also ask them what made you believe aliens create the Face. Furthermore, I would wait for everyone to response to my question.

Second, I would tell them that i truly don't think that aliens can create things like that in any way possible. I would also try to persuade them to believe what I believe such as aliens are not real at all. I would be trying to figure what they are saying. I would then ask what facts do they have to prove that aliens can create faces. Conclusion, I would have facts to prove my point such as it's a Haman head, and it has a nose, moAth, eyes so there is no way possible an alien could of made the Face.
