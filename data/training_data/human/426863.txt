Computer driven cars, the entire of cars, bit is it safe or dangerous. I think dangerous for three reasons. First off what if the computer driven car malfunctions or is even hacked. Secondly will they make new driving laws for these computer driven cars. And last bit not least if its safe then why is it illegal.

Computer are the entire, bIt is it for cars. Computer driven cars can be quiet dangerous. What if the car malfunctions. For example, your driving in the woods heading for your camping spot, bit the car doesn't want to turn. Your heading for a tree and you can't pill the starting wheel what happens next? Or what if your car is being hacked by an Ink own person. How would the car company fix it.

Will they make new driving laws? As stated in the story"New laws will be in order to cover liability in case of an accident". "Who is held responsible the driver or the manufacture". In the story it states "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the safe car has a human driver in control at all times". I know here already tired of the regular driving laws.

If computer driving cars are so safe why is it illegal? In the story it states "As a result in most states it is illegal even to test compIterdriven car." That doesn't sound safe to me. It also states "manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven to be for reliably safe." meaning that there not safe now.

Still think that computer driven cars are still safe? I didn't because of my three reasons. What if the car malfunctions or get hacked? Will they make new laws? If it is safe why is it illegal?
