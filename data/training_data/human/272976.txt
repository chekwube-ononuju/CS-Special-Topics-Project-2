I am against driverless cars because they could cause confusion and delay. They can also be one of the most dangerous things that man kind has made. The safety of the cars are a problem.

First, there are people in the world that are smart and can hack into almost anything. That if someone hacked you car and was able to control where you car goes? Either they are out to kill you or must mess with you. Hackers like that could have you car crash into something to either kill you or to target something else. They could have your carp lung straight into a body of water. But there are the hackers that can mess with you. They can keep you car from turning on or even mess with where you want the car to drive to. That if terrorists got a hold of our car systems? I don't think the world needs any more wars.

Next, what if it's not he hackers but the car itself? The car can simply have something wrong with it. The car could probably have something wrong with its technology, and It could malfunction and either kill you or must not work anymore. When you are driving and your car suddenly stops driving in the middle of a highway, what would you do?

Lastly," who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? You were the one that was driving it you could have done something to the car. But then again, the car company could have made a mistake in the technology resulting in your accident. Each side of the conflict would think that it wasn't there fault, and it could go back and forth in court.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea in the future. All they cause is confusion, danger, and delay. Driverless cars are must another chaotic thing the world has to deal with if it started to become a bother.
