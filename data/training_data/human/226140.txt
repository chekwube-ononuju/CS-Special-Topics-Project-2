Dear senator, the way we elect these countries President is flawed and ineffective. We technically don't directly vote for the President, we vote for some Person who then chooses the President. Since this country is democratic it thinks that the Popular vote is definitely the way to elect the future Residents.

To start off, the electoral college isn't fair to voters because candidates only go to states where they know they will get the vote. In the article "The indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong" it says "The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't send time in the states they know they have no chance at winning". People vote for the Person who they want to be in office not for someone who might vote for the Person who you want. I guess you could say voters in swing states are going to know more about the election. But you never know that does not always happen.

Secondly the electors could be anyone and could be chosen by anybody, there are no kinds of qualifications. On the other hand the regular voters actually have to meet some sort of standards like you aren't allowed to vote if you have committed some sort of crime a certain amount times. And most of the time the American People don't see adds or commercials about the electorates. Howdy we know we can trust these random People with our vote? In my eyes and Probably most Peoples eyes, see this system as a nondemocratic way to vote for our President.

To conclude our country should switch to the Popular vote system strictly because the electoral college is an unfair, undemocratic way of choosing our nations future leader.
