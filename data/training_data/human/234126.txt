Citizens of the United States should participate in the "Seagoing Cowboys" program. First off they are sending animals such as horses, young cows, and mules to the countries that were devastated from World War 2. Also they get the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Last they are serving for the organization of UNR RM. And this people are why you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.

To support the reason that they get the benefit of seeing Europe and China. They see most of Europe. They see most of China too. And they see what most ordinary people don't get to. This shows why people should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.

And to support the reason that you're serving for the organization of UNR RM. They are part of the UNR RM. The UNR RM stands for (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). And so they are helping the devastated countries of Europe and China from World War 2.

Last to support the reason that they are helping others in need of animals from the devastation of World War 2. They are giving people animals. They are also giving people their needs. And from those animals they are getting people the products they need.

And I see why people do not want to join the program. Maybe they want to stay with their families, or they get sea sick, or the fact that they just don't like animals.

In conclusion this is why people need to join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program. Like I said, they are sending animals to the countries that were devastated from World War 2. They also get the benefit of seeing Europe and China. They are also serving for the organization of the UNR RM. Now I recommend you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.
