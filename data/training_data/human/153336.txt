Dear senator, I wish to ask you a favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the present of the United States. First, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president.

Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascertainment. Listing all the presidents who ran for president. After the presidential election is had every four years on a tusedayafter the first Monday in November. You help chose your states electors.

Furthermore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh, yea and senior under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidential party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the parties nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not withe national popular vote.

Yo Mr. senator sir I'm only asking you this one thing if u could just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. Pleez that's all I'm asking from you toÂ do for me just one thing. Quite some thing to do right .
