A lot of students become involved in extracurricular activities, and that makes them don't have time enough to finish their homework and assignments. Schools should control student's involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students can't make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them don't focus a lot on their studying and education.

My first reason that the schools should control students' involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldn't have a good future.

Secondly, when the schools control the student's involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes.

The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future.

Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not.

That was the reasons about how the schools should control the students involvement in activities and how it is good for the student's education and future on the same time. Because students can't make their own decisions; sometimes they feel that somethings good for them but it is not, so they need someone more mature to show them the right ways and right things.
