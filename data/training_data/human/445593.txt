Dear Senator,

I believe that we should change the election to the most popular vote instead of keeping the electoral college. She Electoral College was a good idea proposed by the Founding Fathers, But I believe that it is time to kind of switch it up.

Changing the Election to popular vote instead of keeping the Electoral college is a much better idea if you ask me. Mostly because this is a free country, and we are the people of this country who have been given rights to vote for our own president. Not to vote for our own president then have the congress vote too. So me its kind of seems like you just have to question the process a little. At the end of all of this that president is representing the people and trying his/her best to make us happy and keep us happy.

By the president being elected off of the electoral process it is allowing the congress to vote and having the congress vote will not put the president we won't in the chair. It is just basically them having control lover us, they will still have the power but they just won't you to think that your getting ahead by allowing you to vote. And don't get me wrong yes the citizens vote will still count, but our president is not being elected the way we would want him to be.

So I just believe that the votes should just go off of the most popular votes instead of the electoral process. Shat way most people won't feel cheated from their votes and like congress is ahead still this is a freedom country not a country where they make you believe your ahead and then twist things up and make you feel stumped on or cheated the president we want and vote for should be in office not a president that the citizens and the congress vote for. Which is why we should start using the Most popular vote system with only the citizens.
