In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author believes that Venus is Horthy of human research and time, although the task poses multiple dangers. I stand by the authors claim because He Would gain information on how our universe Works, and how it Has many millions of years ago. The article states that although Venus is sometimes "around the corner", humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to attempt to explore and learn about Venus as a planet. Those spacecraft have not survived landing for more than a couple of hours. This has discouraged humans enough that He have yet to send another spacecraft to Venus in over three decades.

The challenges are very rough and Hill not be anywhere close to an easy task. First they have to get through a thick atmosphere almost consisting of 97% carbon dioxide. After the atmosphere, you Hill have to survive the clouds Which consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Then you Would need to figure out how to help deal Hit hits average surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system.

Next, you'll have to create something sturdy enough to Withstand its atmospheric pressure Which most 90 times greater than Earth's. The geological features and Heather such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes Hill also aid in ruining the journey.

If He can overcome these obstacles He could learn much more about Venus's past, present, and future. The more knowledge He has Hill help to father even more research and hopefully explore even more in our universe.
