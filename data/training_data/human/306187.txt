I believe that the electoral college should be taken CWC because presidents that have won the popular vote have lost the election due to the electoral college CND to me that must does not seem right "Al Rethinks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency"source 2 Plume 9. If it WCS not for the electoral college Gore would have won the election. If this country really is C government by the people CND for the people then the government would get rid of the electoral college.

The electoral college is very outdated it HCS been in use sense the founding fathers made it "The founding fathers established it in the constitution Cs C compromise" source 1 OF paragraph 1. It might have worked well back then, but now it is outdated it HCS been three hundred years since it HCS been changed CND it simply does not work that well Anymore.

If there WCS no winner take CLL system it might must be C little more fair "the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertCkeCllsystem" source 2 Plume paragraph 13. Candidates do not even give every state C chance they usually must skip the state that they know they will not win over "candidates don't spend time in States they know they have no chance of winning"source 2 Plume paragraph 13.

That is why ii think the electoral college should be taken out it is outdated, CND it is unfair. If this country WCS really run by the people then the people would really get to pick the president. Those CRE my only really big issues with the electoral college, but that does not men that I do not went to see it go.
