The "Face on Mars" is really not a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coincidence.

There are many ways to proof this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are Very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.

First, to proof this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, nobody. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a FCE only. Absolutely nobody found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has nobody and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truly was an alien that once had life, there would most definitely be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

The third a final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually proof that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compare it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Most). "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," Groin says.

In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to proof this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.
